- *Lesson 2: Information Theory*  
  - Entropy of binary outcomes  
  - Binary coding of symbols

- *Lesson 3: Across Disciplines & Integration*  
  - Physics: qubit simulation  
  - Economics: market buy/sell decisions  
  - Biology: DNA encoding into binary  
  - Computing: parity check for error detection  

- *Challenge Section: Integrated exercises of models*
   - Public Health: Epidemic spread
   - Economy: Market Uncertanty
   - Biology: DNA mutation

- *Additional Demos*
  - integration_demo      % Lebesgue vs Riemann integration
   -lagrange_demo         % Lagrange multipliers (economics & engineering)
   -wyner_ziv_demo        % Wyner–Ziv coding with Laplacian + Gaussian noise
   -filters_vs_nn_demo    % FIR filters vs neural network convolution
    -control_demo          % LQR optimal control, floating vs fixed-point

## ▶️ How to Run

- Run the script for each *Lesson* in the folders "study": lesson1.m, lesson2.m, lesson3.m and lesson4.m. They represent a *hands-on study path* with simulations, exercises, and visualizations that make the book's ideas tangible.

- Run the script for each exammple for the *Challenge Section* contain in the folder "challenges".

- Run the script for each additional demo in the folder "demos", which were listed earlier.

  ALL SCRIPTS INCLUDE COMMENTS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR DIDACTINAL PORPOUSES AND TO ALLOW A EASY TRANSLATION TO ANY OTHER COMPUTER LANGUAGUE.
